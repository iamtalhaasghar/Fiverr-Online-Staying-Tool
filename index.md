# Any Website-Online-Staying-Tool (Beta Version)
A very easy and simple to use tool to stay online on Any Website as long as your PC is on.


# How to Use
<ol>
  <li>First of all Take the screenshot of the reload button located on your browser.</li>
  <li>Rename that screenshot file to "reload.png" and place that in a folder where executable file of this tool is located.</li>
  <li>If there is already a file present with the name "reload.png" you can replace it without any danger.</li>
  <li>Make sure the name of the file is "reload.png". Be aware that the all letters are in lower case. Changing the case of letters might ran you into a problem.</li>

  <li>Customize the settings or use default settings if you want.</li>

</ol>

# Features
<ul>
  <li>Actually by using this tool you can automate your computer`s mouse pointer to click on anything you want repeatedly after some time say "X" seconds.</li>
<li>To be honest I use it to stay online on Any Website.com. I use this tool to automate clicking on my browser`s reload button after every 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>You can specify the sleep time.</li>
  <li>You can see how many times the mouse was clicked using the tool.</li>
</ul>
